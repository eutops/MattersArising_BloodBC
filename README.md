## About

This code accompanies the matters arising '**Validation of blood-based detection of breast cancer highlights importance for cross-population validation**', by Theeuwes *et al.* (2024) and provides the necessary scripts to perform analyses and reproduce figures and display items.

## Abstract

> *Arising from [Wang et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40389-5)*. Wang et al. 1 recently described a new PCR-based test for breast cancer detection based on DNA methylation (DNAme) in peripheral blood-derived monocytes (PBMCs), reporting a strikingly high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 when combining four DNAme sites in a multiplex based methylation-specific quantitative PCR assay. Individual loci within their multiplex assay achieved an AUC of at least 0.69 in their discovery set derived from Illumina Methylation array data. In independent whole blood methylation datasets, we observe a limited ability to distinguish breast cancer cases from controls (n=208 controls, n=102 cases; maximum AUCs of 0.59 for individual, or 0.60 for combined loci, respectively), underscoring the importance of cross-population validation of diagnostic biomarkers prior to clinical implementation. Notably, we show that individuals with systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis show similar changes in selected sites, suggesting that the observed signal may be at least in part associated with inflammation.

## Guide to contents and structure

All display items can be reproduced with `Figures.Rmd`. It calls separate script and .Rdata dataframe files contained in the folder `data`.

* `download`: 
	+ Contains code for downloading publicly available datasets from GEO and TCGA.
* `analyses`:
	+ Contains scripts named after their respective datasets. These scripts extract relevant loci and phenotypic features from beta and pheno files, preprocessed by their corresponding scripts in `download`.
	+ Includes the `methylationQTL` script used for methylation quantitative trait analyses.
* `data`:
	+ Methylation values for each selected locus and accompanying phenotypic information for each analyzed dataset. This data is the output of scripts found in `analyses`.
* `figures`: 
	+ Consists of subdirectories `jpg` and `pdf` containing the main and supplementary display items as generated by (`Figures.Rmd`).
* `src`: 
	+ Contains helper functions for unzipping publicly available datasets from GEO (called from `download`) and helper functions used for plotting (called from `Figures.Rmd`).
